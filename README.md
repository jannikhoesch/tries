# Empirical Study of Tries

## Overview
This project involves conducting experiments with three different trie structures: Array-Trie, List-Trie, and BST-Trie (TST). These experiments are designed to measure and compare the performance in terms of time and memory efficiency across various trie implementations using synthetic and structured data sets.

## Repository Contents

- `TrieArray.py`, `TrieList.py`, `TrieBST.py`: Implementations of each Trie type.
- `shakespeare.txt`: Text file used as the source for word extraction in experiment 1.
- `experiment-1.py`: Script that includes functions to run the experiment 1.
- `experiment-2.py`: Script that includes functions to run the experiment 2.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for running the experiments.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `Hoesch_Jannik-4-trieexperiments.pdf`: Project report.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

- Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

- To start experiment 1, run:
    ```sh
    python experiment-1.py
  
- To start experiment 2, run:
    ```sh
    python experiment-2.py
